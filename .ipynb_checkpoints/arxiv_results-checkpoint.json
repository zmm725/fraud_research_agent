    "abstract": "Intrusion detection system (IDS) is an important part of enterprise security\nsystem architecture. In particular, anomaly-based IDS has been widely applied\nto detect abnormal process behaviors that deviate from the majority. However,\nsuch abnormal behavior usually consists of a series of low-level heterogeneous\nevents. The gap between the low-level events and the high-level abnormal\nbehaviors makes it hard to infer which single events are related to the real\nabnormal activities, especially considering that there are massive \"noisy\"\nlow-level events happening in between. Hence, the existing work that focus on\ndetecting single entities/events can hardly achieve high detection accuracy.\nDifferent from previous work, we design and implement GID, an efficient\ngraph-based intrusion detection technique that can identify abnormal event\nsequences from a massive heterogeneous process traces with high accuracy. GID\nfirst builds a compact graph structure to capture the interactions between\ndifferent system entities. The suspiciousness or anomaly score of process paths\nis then measured by leveraging random walk technique to the constructed acyclic\ndirected graph. To eliminate the score bias from the path length, the Box-Cox\npower transformation based approach is introduced to normalize the anomaly\nscores so that the scores of paths of different lengths have the same\ndistribution. The efficiency of suspicious path discovery is further improved\nby the proposed optimization scheme. We fully implement our GID algorithm and\ndeploy it into a real enterprise security system, and it greatly helps detect\nthe advanced threats, and optimize the incident response.

In this paper, a anomaly detection method for\nlarge-scale Internet topology is proposed by considering the changes of network\ncrashes. In order to quantify the dynamic changes of Internet topology, the\nnetwork path changes coefficient(NPCC) is put forward which will highlight the\nInternet abnormal state after it is attacked continuously. Furthermore we\nproposed the decision function which is inspired by Fibonacci Sequence to\ndetermine whether the Internet is abnormal or not. That is the current Internet\nis abnormal if its NPCC is beyond the normal domain which structured by the\nprevious k NPCCs of Internet topology. Finally the new Internet anomaly\ndetection method was tested over the topology data of three Internet anomaly\nevents. The results show that the detection accuracy of all events are over\n97%, the detection precision of each event are 90.24%, 83.33% and 66.67%, when\nk = 36. According to the experimental values of the index F_1, we found the the\nbetter the detection performance is, the bigger the k is, and our method has\nbetter performance for the anomaly behaviors caused by network failure than\nthat caused by intentional attack.

However, these rule-based approaches often generalize poorly\nand identify only those patterns that are already known to researchers. An\nalternative approach that does not rely on known malicious behavior patterns\ncan potentially also detect previously unseen patterns.

Furthermore, we propose a K-NN similarity-based statistical model\nto detect anomalies over time and space, which is an unsupervised one-class\nlearning algorithm requiring no clustering nor any prior assumption. Firstly,\nwe retrieve the K-NN samples from the training set in regard to the testing\nsample, and then use the similarities between every pair of the K-NN samples to\nconstruct a Gaussian model. Finally, the probabilities of the similarities from\nthe testing sample to the K-NN samples under the Gaussian model are calculated\nin the form of a joint probability. Abnormal events can be detected by judging\nwhether the joint probability is below predefined thresholds in terms of time\nand space, separately. Such a scheme can adapt to the whole scene, since the\nprobability computed as such is not affected by motion distortions arising from\nperspective distortion.

However, there is usually a gap between the time that a\nuser commits a fraudulent action and the time that the user is suspended by the\nplatform. How to detect fraudsters in time is a challenging problem. Most of\nthe existing approaches adopt classifiers to predict fraudsters given their\nactivity sequences along time. The main drawback of classification models is\nthat the prediction results between consecutive timestamps are often\ninconsistent. In this paper, we propose a survival analysis based fraud early\ndetection model, SAFE, which maps dynamic user activities to survival\nprobabilities that are guaranteed to be monotonically decreasing along time.\nSAFE adopts recurrent neural network (RNN) to handle user activity sequences\nand directly outputs hazard values at each timestamp, and then, survival\nprobability derived from hazard values is deployed to achieve consistent\npredictions. Because we only observe the user suspended time instead of the\nfraudulent activity time in the training data, we revise the loss function of\nthe regular survival model to achieve fraud early detection. Experimental\nresults on two real world datasets demonstrate that SAFE outperforms both the\nsurvival analysis model and recurrent neural network model alone as well as\nstate-of-the-art fraud early detection approaches.",

There are many existing methods for anomaly detection in network\ntraffic, such as number of packets. However, there is non established method\ndetecting anomalies in a time series of flow interaction patterns that can be\nrepresented as complex network. Firstly, based on proposed multivariate flow\nsimilarity method on temporal locality, a complex network model (MFS-TL) is\nconstructed to describe the interactive behaviors of traffic flows. Having\nanalyzed the relationships between MFS-TL characteristics, temporal locality\nwindow and multivariate flow similarity critical threshold, an approach for\nparameter determination is established. Having observed the evolution of MFS-TL\ncharacteristics, three non-deterministic correlations are defined for network\nstates (i.e. normal or abnormal). Furthermore, intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS)\nis introduced to quantify three non-deterministic correlations, and then a\nanomaly detection method is put forward for single characteristic sequence. To\nbuild an objective IFS, we design a Gaussian distribution-based membership\nfunction with a variable hesitation degree. To determine the mapping of IFS's\nclustering intervals to network states, a distinction index is developed. Then,\nan IFS ensemble method (IFSE-AD) is proposed to eliminate the impacts of the\ninconsistent about MFS-TL characteristic to network state and improve detection\nperformance. Finally, we carried out extensive experiments on several network\ntraffic datasets for anomaly detection, and the results demonstrate the\nsuperiority of IFSE-AD to state-of-the-art approaches, validating the\neffectiveness of our method.",

    "abstract": "Often the challenge associated with tasks like fraud and spam detection is\nthe lack of all likely patterns needed to train suitable supervised learning\nmodels. This problem accentuates when the fraudulent patterns are not only\nscarce, they also change over time. Change in fraudulent pattern is because\nfraudsters continue to innovate novel ways to circumvent measures put in place\nto prevent fraud. Limited data and continuously changing patterns makes\nlearning significantly difficult. We hypothesize that good behavior does not\nchange with time and data points representing good behavior have consistent\nspatial signature under different groupings. Based on this hypothesis we are\nproposing an approach that detects outliers in large data sets by assigning a\nconsistency score to each data point using an ensemble of clustering methods.\nOur main contribution is proposing a novel method that can detect outliers in\nlarge datasets and is robust to changing patterns. We also argue that area\nunder the ROC curve, although a commonly used metric to evaluate outlier\ndetection methods is not the right metric. Since outlier detection problems\nhave a skewed distribution of classes, precision-recall curves are better\nsuited because precision compares false positives to true positives (outliers)\nrather than true negatives (inliers) and therefore is not affected by the\nproblem of class imbalance. We show empirically that area under the\nprecision-recall curve is a better than ROC as an evaluation metric.

These features well match the appearance of anomaly and\ntheir consistency, and accuracy is higher both in regular and irregular areas\ncompared to other descriptors. In this paper, these features are exploited as\ninput prior to train the neural network. The MLP neural network is subsequently\nexplored to consider these features that can detect the anomalous situation.\nThe experimental tests are conducted on a set of benchmark video sequences\ncommonly used for anomaly situation detection.",

    "abstract": "Most real-world datasets, and particularly those collected from physical\nsystems, are full of noise, packet loss, and other imperfections. However, most\nspecification mining, anomaly detection and other such algorithms assume, or\neven require, perfect data quality to function properly. Such algorithms may\nwork in lab conditions when given clean, controlled data, but will fail in the\nfield when given imperfect data. We propose a method for accurately\nreconstructing discrete temporal or sequential system traces affected by data\nloss, using Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs). The model works by\nlearning to predict the next event in a sequence of events, and uses its own\noutput as an input to continue predicting future events. As a result, this\nmethod can be used for data restoration even with streamed data. Such a method\ncan reconstruct even long sequence of missing events, and can also help\nvalidate and improve data quality for noisy data. The output of the model will\nbe a close reconstruction of the true data, and can be fed to algorithms that\nrely on clean data. We demonstrate our method by reconstructing automotive CAN\ntraces consisting of long sequences of discrete events. We show that given even\nsmall parts of a CAN trace, our LSTM model can predict future events with an\naccuracy of almost 90%, and can successfully reconstruct large portions of the\noriginal trace, greatly outperforming a Markov Model benchmark. We separately\nfeed the original, lossy, and reconstructed traces into a specification mining\nframework to perform downstream analysis of the effect of our method on\nstate-of-the-art models that use these traces for understanding the behavior of\ncomplex systems.",

    "abstract": "Automated fraud behaviors detection on electronic payment platforms is a\ntough problem. Fraud users often exploit the vulnerability of payment platforms\nand the carelessness of users to defraud money, steal passwords, do money\nlaundering, etc, which causes enormous losses to digital payment platforms and\nusers. There are many challenges for fraud detection in practice. Traditional\nfraud detection methods require a large-scale manually labeled dataset, which\nis hard to obtain in reality. Manually labeled data cost tremendous human\nefforts. Besides, the continuous and rapid evolution of fraud users makes it\nhard to find new fraud patterns based on existing detection rules. In our work,\nwe propose a real-world data oriented detection paradigm which can detect fraud\nusers and upgrade its detection ability automatically. Based on the new\nparadigm, we design a novel fraud detection model, FraudJudger, to analyze\nusers behaviors on digital payment platforms and detect fraud users with fewer\nlabeled data in training. FraudJudger can learn the latent representations of\nusers from unlabeled data with the help of Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE).\nFurthermore, FraudJudger can find new fraud patterns from unknown users by\ncluster analysis. Our experiment is based on a real-world electronic payment\ndataset. Comparing with other well-known fraud detection methods, FraudJudger\ncan achieve better detection performance with only 10% labeled data.",

In this way, complex travel\nbehavior can be modeled as a mixture of representative and interpretable\nspatiotemporal patterns. By applying the trained model on future/unseen\nspatiotemporal records of a traveler, we can detect her behavior anomalies by\nscoring those observations using perplexity. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed modeling framework on a real-world license plate recognition\n(LPR) data set. The results confirm the advantage of statistical learning\nmethods in modeling sparse individual travel behavior data. This type of\npattern discovery and anomaly detection applications can provide useful\ninsights for traffic monitoring, law enforcement, and individual travel\nbehavior profiling.",

Anomalies in videos are broadly defined as events or\nactivities that are unusual and signify irregular behavior. The goal of anomaly\ndetection is to temporally or spatially localize the anomaly events in video\nsequences. Temporal localization (i.e. indicating the start and end frames of\nthe anomaly event in a video) is referred to as frame-level detection. Spatial\nlocalization, which is more challenging, means to identify the pixels within\neach anomaly frame that correspond to the anomaly event.

Moreover, the execution environment of ADVs is often open and complex.\nHence, ADVs are always at risk of safety and security threats.

Since self-driving\nfunctions take most of the computation resources and upgrade frequently,\nMulti-IF is designed to work under such resource constraints and support\nfrequent updates. Given the collected sequences of system calls, the\ncombination of different syntax patterns is used to analyze and construct\nfeature vectors of those sequences. By taking the feature vectors as inputs,\none-class support vector machine is adopted to determine whether the current\nsequence of system calls is abnormal, which is trained with the feature vectors\nfrom the normal sequences. The evaluations on both simulated and real data\nprove that the proposed method is effective in identifying the abnormal\nbehavior after minutes of feature extraction and training.

For example, in a safety-critical\nenvironment, it is crucial to have an automatic detection system to screen the\nstreaming data gathered by monitoring sensors and to report abnormal\nobservations if detected in real-time. Oftentimes, stakes are much higher when\nthese potential anomalies are intentional or goal-oriented. We propose an\nend-to-end framework for sequential anomaly detection using inverse\nreinforcement learning (IRL), whose objective is to determine the\ndecision-making agent's underlying function which triggers his/her behavior.\nThe proposed method takes the sequence of actions of a target agent (and\npossibly other meta information) as input. The agent's normal behavior is then\nunderstood by the reward function which is inferred via IRL. We use a neural\nnetwork to represent a reward function. Using a learned reward function, we\nevaluate whether a new observation from the target agent follows a normal\npattern. In order to construct a reliable anomaly detection method and take\ninto consideration the confidence of the predicted anomaly score, we adopt a\nBayesian approach for IRL.

Due to the peculiarity of the rationale behind\nthis work, relying on the number of groups, three different methods of people\ngroup's extraction are compared. Experiments are carried out on the\nMotion-Emotion benchmark data set. Reported results point out in which cases\nthe trit-based measurement of group dynamics allows us to detect the anomaly.\nBesides the promising performance of our approach, we show how it is correlated\nwith the anomaly typology and the camera's perspective to the crowd's flow\n(frontal, lateral).",

The online nature of this method supports\nscalability by avoiding complete policy representation. The lack of an explicit\nrepresentation however hinders interpretability.

The proposed\nmethod explores local properties of policy behavior to identify unexpected\ndecisions.

In this paper, we investigate a black-box scenario, where the system\nunder analysis cannot be instrumented, in this granular fashion.This scenario\nis particularly prevalent with control systems' log analysis in the form of\ncontinuous signals. In this situation, an execution trace amounts to a\nmultivariate time-series of input and output signals, where different states of\nthe system correspond to different `phases` in the time-series. The main\nchallenge is to detect when these phase changes take place. Unfortunately, most\nexisting solutions are either univariate, make assumptions on the data\ndistribution, or have limited learning power.Therefore, we propose a hybrid\ndeep neural network that accepts as input a multivariate time series and\napplies a set of convolutional and recurrent layers to learn the non-linear\ncorrelations between signals and the patterns over time.We show how this\napproach can be used to accurately detect state changes, and how the inferred\nmodels can be successfully applied to transfer-learning scenarios, to\naccurately process traces from different products with similar execution\ncharacteristics. Our experimental results on two UAV autopilot case studies\nindicate that our approach is highly accurate (over 90% F1 score for state\nclassification) and significantly improves baselines (by up to 102% for change\npoint detection).Using transfer learning we also show that up to 90% of the\nmaximum achievable F1 scores in the open-source case study can be achieved by\nreusing the trained models from the industrial case and only fine tuning them\nusing as low as 5 labeled samples, which reduces the manual labeling effort by\n98%.",

In this pattern-based anomaly detection algorithm, we\nincorporate both the anomalousness and utility of a group, and then introduce\nthe concept of utility-aware outlier sequential rule (UOSR). We show that this\nis a more meaningful way for detecting anomalies. Besides, we propose some\nefficient pruning strategies w.r.t. upper bounds for mining UOSR, as well as\nthe outlier detection. An extensive experimental study conducted on several\nreal-world datasets shows that the proposed DUOS algorithm has a better\neffectiveness and efficiency.

    "abstract": "With the explosive growth of the e-commerce industry, detecting online\ntransaction fraud in real-world applications has become increasingly important\nto the development of e-commerce platforms. The sequential behavior history of\nusers provides useful information in differentiating fraudulent payments from\nregular ones. Recently, some approaches have been proposed to solve this\nsequence-based fraud detection problem. However, these methods usually suffer\nfrom two problems: the prediction results are difficult to explain and the\nexploitation of the internal information of behaviors is insufficient. To\ntackle the above two problems, we propose a Hierarchical Explainable Network\n(HEN) to model users' behavior sequences, which could not only improve the\nperformance of fraud detection but also make the inference process\ninterpretable. Meanwhile, as e-commerce business expands to new domains, e.g.,\nnew countries or new markets, one major problem for modeling user behavior in\nfraud detection systems is the limitation of data collection, e.g., very few\ndata/labels available. Thus, in this paper, we further propose a transfer\nframework to tackle the cross-domain fraud detection problem, which aims to\ntransfer knowledge from existing domains (source domains) with enough and\nmature data to improve the performance in the new domain (target domain). Our\nproposed method is a general transfer framework that could not only be applied\nupon HEN but also various existing models in the Embedding & MLP paradigm.\nBased on 90 transfer task experiments, we also demonstrate that our transfer\nframework could not only contribute to the cross-domain fraud detection task\nwith HEN, but also be universal and expandable for various existing models.",

Considering the two common anomaly shapes (point- or\nsequence-outliers) in TS data, we implement two masking strategies with many\nself-generated training samples.

The goal of one-shot learning is to classify\nunlabeled instances when there is only one labeled example per class.\nConventional problem setting of one-shot learning mainly focuses on the data\nthat is already in feature space (such as images). However, the data instances\nin real-world applications are often more complex and feature vectors may not\nbe available. In this paper, we study the problem of one-shot learning on\nattributed sequences, where each instance is composed of a set of attributes\n(e.g., user profile) and a sequence of categorical items (e.g., clickstream).\nThis problem is important for a variety of real-world applications ranging from\nfraud prevention to network intrusion detection.

The task\nstands for identifying abnormal behaviors in financial series, IT systems,\naerospace measurements, and the medical domain, where anomaly detection may aid\nin isolating cases of depression and attend the elderly. Anomaly detection in\ntime series is a complex task since anomalies are rare due to highly non-linear\ntemporal correlations and since the definition of anomalous is sometimes\nsubjective. Here we propose the novel use of Hyperbolic uncertainty for Anomaly\nDetection (HypAD). HypAD learns self-supervisedly to reconstruct the input\nsignal. We adopt best practices from the state-of-the-art to encode the\nsequence by an LSTM, jointly learned with a decoder to reconstruct the signal,\nwith the aid of GAN critics. Uncertainty is estimated end-to-end by means of a\nhyperbolic neural network. By using uncertainty, HypAD may assess whether it is\ncertain about the input signal but it fails to reconstruct it because this is\nanomalous; or whether the reconstruction error does not necessarily imply\nanomaly, as the model is uncertain, e.g. a complex but regular input signal.\nThe novel key idea is that a detectable anomaly is one where the model is\ncertain but it predicts wrongly. HypAD outperforms the current state-of-the-art\nfor univariate anomaly detection on established benchmarks based on data from\nNASA, Yahoo, Numenta, Amazon, and Twitter. It also yields state-of-the-art\nperformance on a multivariate dataset of anomaly activities in elderly home\nresidences, and it outperforms the baseline on SWaT. Overall, HypAD yields the\nlowest false alarms at the best performance rate, thanks to successfully\nidentifying detectable anomalies.",

Rip currents\nare dangerous strong currents that can drag beachgoers out to sea. Most people\nare either unaware of them or do not know what they look like. In some\ninstances, even trained personnel such as lifeguards have difficulty\nidentifying them. RipViz produces a simple, easy to understand visualization of\nrip location overlaid on the source video. With RipViz, we first obtain an\nunsteady 2D vector field from the stationary video using optical flow. Movement\nat each pixel is analyzed over time. At each seed point, sequences of short\npathlines, rather a single long pathline, are traced across the frames of the\nvideo to better capture the quasi-periodic flow behavior of wave activity.\nBecause of the motion on the beach, the surf zone, and the surrounding areas,\nthese pathlines may still appear very cluttered and incomprehensible.\nFurthermore, lay audiences are not familiar with pathlines and may not know how\nto interpret them. To address this, we treat rip currents as a flow anomaly in\nan otherwise normal flow. To learn about the normal flow behavior, we train an\nLSTM autoencoder with pathline sequences from normal ocean, foreground, and\nbackground movements. During test time, we use the trained LSTM autoencoder to\ndetect anomalous pathlines (i.e., those in the rip zone). The origination\npoints of such anomalous pathlines, over the course of the video, are then\npresented as points within the rip zone. RipViz is fully automated and does not\nrequire user input.

    "abstract": "How to obtain informative representations of transactions and then perform\nthe identification of fraudulent transactions is a crucial part of ensuring\nfinancial security. Recent studies apply Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to the\ntransaction fraud detection problem. Nevertheless, they encounter challenges in\neffectively learning spatial-temporal information due to structural\nlimitations. Moreover, few prior GNN-based detectors have recognized the\nsignificance of incorporating global information, which encompasses similar\nbehavioral patterns and offers valuable insights for discriminative\nrepresentation learning. Therefore, we propose a novel heterogeneous graph\nneural network called Spatial-Temporal-Aware Graph Transformer (STA-GT) for\ntransaction fraud detection problems. Specifically, we design a temporal\nencoding strategy to capture temporal dependencies and incorporate it into the\ngraph neural network framework, enhancing spatial-temporal information modeling\nand improving expressive ability. Furthermore, we introduce a transformer\nmodule to learn local and global information. Pairwise node-node interactions\novercome the limitation of the GNN structure and build up the interactions with\nthe target node and long-distance ones. Experimental results on two financial\ndatasets compared to general GNN models and GNN-based fraud detectors\ndemonstrate that our proposed method STA-GT is effective on the transaction\nfraud detection task.",

    "abstract": "Many machine learning methods have been proposed to achieve accurate\ntransaction fraud detection, which is essential to the financial security of\nindividuals and banks. However, most existing methods leverage original\nfeatures only or require manual feature engineering. They lack the ability to\nlearn discriminative representations from transaction data. Moreover, criminals\noften commit fraud by imitating cardholders' behaviors, which causes the poor\nperformance of existing detection models. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive\nSampling and Aggregation-based Graph Neural Network (ASA-GNN) that learns\ndiscriminative representations to improve the performance of transaction fraud\ndetection. A neighbor sampling strategy is performed to filter noisy nodes and\nsupplement information for fraudulent nodes. Specifically, we leverage cosine\nsimilarity and edge weights to adaptively select neighbors with similar\nbehavior patterns for target nodes and then find multi-hop neighbors for\nfraudulent nodes. A neighbor diversity metric is designed by calculating the\nentropy among neighbors to tackle the camouflage issue of fraudsters and\nexplicitly alleviate the over-smoothing phenomena. Extensive experiments on\nthree real financial datasets demonstrate that the proposed method ASA-GNN\noutperforms state-of-the-art ones.",

Traditional and learning-based anomaly detection\nmethods face significant limitations due to the sequential nature of these logs\nand the lack of a rich, node-specific text corpus. To address this, we propose\nan approach utilizing word embeddings to represent log entries and a Hidden\nMarkov Model (HMM) to model the typical sequential patterns of these embeddings\nfor individual nodes.

For applications like click fraud and fake reviews, some users\ncan maliciously perform corrupted (disrupted) behaviors to trick the system.\nTherefore, it is crucial to design efficient online learning algorithms to\nrobustly learn from potentially corrupted user behaviors and accurately\nidentify the corrupted users in an online manner. Existing works propose bandit\nalgorithms robust to adversarial corruption. However, these algorithms are\ndesigned for a single user, and cannot leverage the implicit social relations\namong multiple users for more efficient learning. Moreover, none of them\nconsider how to detect corrupted users online in the multiple-user scenario. In\nthis paper, we present an important online learning problem named LOCUD to\nlearn and utilize unknown user relations from disrupted behaviors to speed up\nlearning, and identify the corrupted users in an online setting. To robustly\nlearn and utilize the unknown relations among potentially corrupted users, we\npropose a novel bandit algorithm RCLUB-WCU. To detect the corrupted users, we\ndevise a novel online detection algorithm OCCUD based on RCLUB-WCU's inferred\nuser relations. We prove a regret upper bound for RCLUB-WCU, which\nasymptotically matches the lower bound with respect to $T$ up to logarithmic\nfactors, and matches the state-of-the-art results in degenerate cases.

While our initial examples focus on detecting radio-frequency\ninterference (RFI) in digitized signals within the field of radio astronomy, it\nis important to note that SigNova's applicability extends to any type of\nstreamed data. The framework comprises three primary components. Firstly, we\nuse the signature transform to extract a canonical collection of summary\nstatistics from observational sequences. This allows us to represent\nvariable-length visibility samples as finite-dimensional feature vectors.\nSecondly, each feature vector is assigned a novelty score, calculated as the\nMahalanobis distance to its nearest neighbor in an RFI-free training set. By\nthresholding these scores we identify observation ranges that deviate from the\nexpected behavior of RFI-free visibility samples without relying on stringent\ndistributional assumptions. Thirdly, we integrate this anomaly detector with\nPysegments, a segmentation algorithm, to localize consecutive observations\ncontaminated with RFI, if any. This approach provides a compelling alternative\nto classical windowing techniques commonly used for RFI detection. Importantly,\nthe complexity of our algorithm depends on the RFI pattern rather than on the\nsize of the observation window. We demonstrate how SigNova improves the\ndetection of various types of RFI (e.g., broadband and narrowband) in\ntime-frequency visibility data. We validate our framework on the Murchison\nWidefield Array (MWA) telescope and simulated data and the Hydrogen Epoch of\nReionization Array (HERA).",

    "abstract": "The rampant fraudulent activities on Ethereum hinder the healthy development\nof the blockchain ecosystem, necessitating the reinforcement of regulations.\nHowever, multiple imbalances involving account interaction frequencies and\ninteraction types in the Ethereum transaction environment pose significant\nchallenges to data mining-based fraud detection research. To address this, we\nfirst propose the concept of meta-interactions to refine interaction behaviors\nin Ethereum, and based on this, we present a dual self-supervision enhanced\nEthereum fraud detection framework, named Meta-IFD. This framework initially\nintroduces a generative self-supervision mechanism to augment the interaction\nfeatures of accounts, followed by a contrastive self-supervision mechanism to\ndifferentiate various behavior patterns, and ultimately characterizes the\nbehavioral representations of accounts and mines potential fraud risks through\nmulti-view interaction feature learning. Extensive experiments on real Ethereum\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework in\ndetecting common Ethereum fraud behaviors such as Ponzi schemes and phishing\nscams. Additionally, the generative module can effectively alleviate the\ninteraction distribution imbalance in Ethereum data, while the contrastive\nmodule significantly enhances the framework's ability to distinguish different\nbehavior patterns.

    "abstract": "Fraud detection presents a challenging task characterized by ever-evolving\nfraud patterns and scarce labeled data. Existing methods predominantly rely on\ngraph-based or sequence-based approaches. While graph-based approaches connect\nusers through shared entities to capture structural information, they remain\nvulnerable to fraudsters who can disrupt or manipulate these connections. In\ncontrast, sequence-based approaches analyze users' behavioral patterns,\noffering robustness against tampering but overlooking the interactions between\nsimilar users. Inspired by cohort analysis in retention and healthcare, this\npaper introduces VecAug, a novel cohort-augmented learning framework that\naddresses these challenges by enhancing the representation learning of target\nusers with personalized cohort information. To this end, we first propose a\nvector burn-in technique for automatic cohort identification, which retrieves a\ntask-specific cohort for each target user. Then, to fully exploit the cohort\ninformation, we introduce an attentive cohort aggregation technique for\naugmenting target user representations. To improve the robustness of such\ncohort augmentation, we also propose a novel label-aware cohort neighbor\nseparation mechanism to distance negative cohort neighbors and calibrate the\naggregated cohort information. By integrating this cohort information with\ntarget user representations, VecAug enhances the modeling capacity and\ngeneralization capabilities of the model to be augmented. Our framework is\nflexible and can be seamlessly integrated with existing fraud detection models.\nWe deploy our framework on e-commerce platforms and evaluate it on three fraud\ndetection datasets, and results show that VecAug improves the detection\nperformance of base models by up to 2.48\\% in AUC and 22.5\\% in R@P$_{0.9}$,\noutperforming state-of-the-art methods significantly.",

Graph neural\nnetworks are a type of deep learning model that can utilize the interactive\nrelationships within graph structures, and they have been widely applied in the\nfield of fraud detection.

First,\nfraudulent activities only account for a very small part of transaction\ntransfers, leading to an inevitable problem of label imbalance in fraud\ndetection. At the same time, fraudsters often disguise their behavior, which\ncan have a negative impact on the final prediction results. In addition,\nexisting research has overlooked the importance of balancing neighbor\ninformation and central node information.

In addition, most existing\napproaches ignore the timestamps in log data, which can potentially provide\nfine-grained sequential and temporal information. In this work, we propose a\nconfigurable Transformer-based anomaly detection model that can capture the\nsemantic, sequential, and temporal information in the log data and allows us to\nconfigure the different types of information as the model's features.\nAdditionally, we train and evaluate the proposed model using log sequences of\ndifferent lengths, thus overcoming the constraint of existing methods that rely\non fixed-length or time-windowed log sequences as inputs.

The model can attain competitive and consistently stable performance\ncompared to the baselines when presented with log sequences of varying lengths.\nThe results indicate that the event occurrence information plays a key role in\nidentifying anomalies, while the impact of the sequential and temporal\ninformation is not significant for anomaly detection on the studied public\ndatasets.

The D-IDS facilitates central\nmonitoring of the detected anomalies from the geographically distributed\nsubstations and to the control center. The proposed algorithm provides an\noptimal solution to detect network intrusions and abnormal behavior. Different\ntypes of IDS rules based on packet payload, packet flow, and time threshold are\ngenerated. Further, IDS testing and evaluation is performed with a set of rules\nin different sequences. The detection time is measured for different IDS rules,\nand the results are plotted. All the experiments are conducted at Power Cyber\nLab, Iowa State University, for multiple power grid models. After successful\ntesting and evaluation, knowledge and implementation are transferred to field\ndeployment.",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection (AD) is a critical machine learning task with diverse\napplications in web systems, including fraud detection, content moderation, and\nuser behavior analysis. Despite its significance, AD in natural language\nprocessing (NLP) remains underexplored, limiting advancements in detecting\nanomalies in text data such as harmful content, phishing attempts, or spam\nreviews. In this paper, we introduce NLP-ADBench, the most comprehensive\nbenchmark for NLP anomaly detection (NLP-AD), comprising eight curated datasets\nand evaluations of nineteen state-of-the-art algorithms. These include three\nend-to-end methods and sixteen two-step algorithms that apply traditional\nanomaly detection techniques to language embeddings generated by\nbert-base-uncased and OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large models.\n  Our results reveal critical insights and future directions for NLP-AD.\nNotably, no single model excels across all datasets, highlighting the need for\nautomated model selection. Moreover, two-step methods leveraging\ntransformer-based embeddings consistently outperform specialized end-to-end\napproaches, with OpenAI embeddings demonstrating superior performance over BERT\nembeddings. By releasing NLP-ADBench at\nhttps://github.com/USC-FORTIS/NLP-ADBench, we provide a standardized framework\nfor evaluating NLP-AD methods, fostering the development of innovative\napproaches.

Many\nsupervised and unsupervised learning methods have been proposed recently for\nlog-based anomaly detection. State-of-the-art unsupervised methods predict the\nnext log event given a log sequence and apply fixed configurations that use the\nsame filter condition (i.e. k, the top k predicted log events will be regarded\nas normal next events) which leads to inferior performance in the detection\nstage because it sets one fixed k for all log sequences, which ignores the\ndynamic nature and variance in different log sequences.

In this work, we contend that it is necessary to\napply adaptive filters for different log sequences.

We\ndefine the Markov Decision Process (MDP) and formulate the learned adaptive\nfilter as a problem that can be solved by DRL.

    "abstract": "This study proposes an algorithm for detecting suspicious behaviors in large\npayment flows based on deep generative models. By combining Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GAN) and Variational Autoencoders (VAE), the algorithm is\ndesigned to detect abnormal behaviors in financial transactions. First, the GAN\nis used to generate simulated data that approximates normal payment flows. The\ndiscriminator identifies anomalous patterns in transactions, enabling the\ndetection of potential fraud and money laundering behaviors. Second, a VAE is\nintroduced to model the latent distribution of payment flows, ensuring that the\ngenerated data more closely resembles real transaction features, thus improving\nthe model's detection accuracy. The method optimizes the generative\ncapabilities of both GAN and VAE, ensuring that the model can effectively\ncapture suspicious behaviors even in sparse data conditions. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional\nmachine learning algorithms and other deep learning models across various\nevaluation metrics, especially in detecting rare fraudulent behaviors.\nFurthermore, this study provides a detailed comparison of performance in\nrecognizing different transaction patterns (such as normal, money laundering,\nand fraud) in large payment flows, validating the advantages of generative\nmodels in handling complex financial data.",

This paper presents a conceptual framework that applies\ndynamic, behavior-based penalties to deter auction fraud using blockchain smart\ncontracts. Unlike traditional post-auction detection methods, this approach\nprevents manipulation in real-time by introducing an economic disincentive\nsystem where penalty severity scales with suspicious bidding patterns. The\nframework employs the proposed Bid Shill Score (BSS) to evaluate nine distinct\nbidding behaviors, dynamically adjusting the penalty fees to make fraudulent\nactivity financially unaffordable while providing fair competition.\n  The system is implemented within a decentralized English auction on the\nEthereum blockchain, demonstrating how smart contracts enforce transparent\nauction rules without trusted intermediaries. Simulations confirm the\neffectiveness of the proposed model: the dynamic penalty mechanism reduces the\nprofitability of shill bidding while keeping penalties low for honest bidders.\nPerformance evaluation shows that the system introduces only moderate gas and\nlatency overhead, keeping transaction costs and response times within practical\nbounds for real-world use.

However, the frequency of abnormal database access behaviors, such as\ndatabase intrusion by internal and external attacks, continues to rise.\nInternal masqueraders often have greater organizational knowledge, making it\neasier to mimic employee behavior effectively. In contrast, external\nmasqueraders may behave differently due to their lack of familiarity with the\norganization. Current approaches lack the granularity needed to detect\nanomalies at the operational level, frequently misclassifying entire sequences\nof operations as anomalies, even though most operations are likely to represent\nnormal behavior. On the other hand, some anomalous behaviors often resemble\nnormal activities, making them difficult for existing detection methods to\nidentify. This paper introduces a two-tiered anomaly detection approach for\nStructured Query Language (SQL) using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations\nfrom Transformers (BERT) model, specifically DistilBERT, a more efficient,\npre-trained version. Our method combines both unsupervised and supervised\nmachine learning techniques to accurately identify anomalous activities while\nminimizing the need for data labeling. First, the unsupervised method uses\nensemble anomaly detectors that flag embedding vectors distant from learned\nnormal patterns of typical user behavior across the database (out-of-scope\nqueries). Second, the supervised method uses fine-tuned transformer-based\nmodels to detect internal attacks with high precision (in-scope queries), using\nrole-labeled classification, even on limited labeled SQL data. Our findings\nmake a significant contribution by providing an effective solution for\nsafeguarding critical database systems from sophisticated threats.",

    "abstract": "As smart homes become increasingly prevalent, intelligent models are widely\nused for tasks such as anomaly detection and behavior prediction. These models\nare typically trained on static datasets, making them brittle to behavioral\ndrift caused by seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts, or evolving routines.\nHowever, collecting new behavior data for retraining is often impractical due\nto its slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose\nSmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior\ndata to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen\nconsists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware\nSplit module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically\ncoherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose\nSemantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving\nrepresentative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third,\nwe introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior\nrelationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the\nLLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core\nbehavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify\nand remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve\nthe factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences.\nExperiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartGen\nsignificantly enhances model performance on anomaly detection and behavior\nprediction tasks under behavioral drift, with anomaly detection improving by\n85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average.

    "abstract": "This study examines how Artificial Intelligence can aid in identifying and\nmitigating cyber threats in the U.S. across four key areas: intrusion\ndetection, malware classification, phishing detection, and insider threat\nanalysis. Each of these problems has its quirks, meaning there needs to be\ndifferent approaches to each, so we matched the models to the shape of the\nproblem. For intrusion detection, catching things like unauthorized access, we\ntested unsupervised anomaly detection methods. Isolation forests and deep\nautoencoders both gave us useful signals by picking up odd patterns in network\ntraffic. When it came to malware detection, we leaned on ensemble models like\nRandom Forest and XGBoost, trained on features pulled from files and traffic\nlogs. Phishing was more straightforward. We fed standard classifiers (logistic\nregression, Random Forest, XGBoost) a mix of email and web-based features.\nThese models handled the task surprisingly well. Phishing turned out to be the\neasiest problem to crack, at least with the data we had. There was a different\nstory. We utilized an LSTM autoencoder to identify behavioral anomalies in user\nactivity logs. It caught every suspicious behavior but flagged a lot of\nharmless ones too. That kind of model makes sense when the cost of missing a\nthreat is high and you are willing to sift through some noise. What we saw\nacross the board is that performance was not about stacking the most complex\nmodel. What mattered was how well the models structure matched the way the data\nbehaved. When signals were strong and obvious, simple models worked fine. But\nfor messier, more subtle threats, we needed something more adaptive, sequence\nmodels and anomaly detectors, though they brought their trade offs. The\ntakeaway here is clear in cybersecurity, context drives the solution.",

    "abstract": "Predictive models play a crucial role in the financial industry, enabling\nrisk prediction, fraud detection, and personalized recommendations, where\nslight changes in core model performance can result in billions of dollars in\nrevenue or losses. While financial institutions have access to enormous amounts\nof user data (e.g., bank transactions, in-app events, and customer support\nlogs), leveraging this data effectively remains challenging due to its\ncomplexity and scale. Thus, in many financial institutions, most production\nmodels follow traditional machine learning (ML) approaches by converting\nunstructured data into manually engineered tabular features. Conversely, other\ndomains (e.g., natural language processing) have effectively utilized\nself-supervised learning (SSL) to learn rich representations from raw data,\nremoving the need for manual feature extraction. In this paper, we investigate\nusing transformer-based representation learning models for transaction data,\nhypothesizing that these models, trained on massive data, can provide a novel\nand powerful approach to understanding customer behavior. We propose a new\nmethod enabling the use of SSL with transaction data by adapting\ntransformer-based models to handle both textual and structured attributes. Our\napproach, denoted nuFormer, includes an end-to-end fine-tuning method that\nintegrates user embeddings with existing tabular features. Our experiments\ndemonstrate improvements for large-scale recommendation problems at Nubank.\nNotably, these gains are achieved solely through enhanced representation\nlearning rather than incorporating new data sources.",

    "abstract": "When the available data for a target domain is limited, transfer learning\n(TL) methods can be used to develop models on related data-rich domains, before\ndeploying them on the target domain. However, these TL methods are typically\ndesigned with specific, static assumptions on the amount of available labeled\nand unlabeled target data. This is in contrast with many real world\napplications, where the availability of data and corresponding labels varies\nover time. Since the evaluation of the TL methods is typically also performed\nunder the same static data availability assumptions, this would lead to\nunrealistic expectations concerning their performance in real world settings.\nTo support a more realistic evaluation and comparison of TL algorithms and\nmodels, we propose a data manipulation framework that (1) simulates varying\ndata availability scenarios over time, (2) creates multiple domains through\nresampling of a given dataset and (3) introduces inter-domain variability by\napplying realistic domain transformations, e.g., creating a variety of\npotentially time-dependent covariate and concept shifts. These capabilities\nenable simulation of a large number of realistic variants of the experiments,\nin turn providing more information about the potential behavior of algorithms\nwhen deployed in dynamic settings. We demonstrate the usefulness of the\nproposed framework by performing a case study on a proprietary real-world suite\nof card payment datasets. Given the confidential nature of the case study, we\nalso illustrate the use of the framework on the publicly available Bank Account\nFraud (BAF) dataset. By providing a methodology for evaluating TL methods over\ntime and in realistic data availability scenarios, our framework facilitates\nunderstanding of the behavior of models and algorithms.

    "abstract": "Financial fraud detection is essential to safeguard billions of dollars, yet\nthe intertwined entities and fast-changing transaction behaviors in modern\nfinancial systems routinely defeat conventional machine learning models. Recent\ngraph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks,\nbut they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal\nmotifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as\nthey unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when\nfraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both\nsignals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages\ntemporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor\ncondenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs,\npreserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed\nby dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single\nmotif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step\nfraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner\ntailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus\nprecisely on the most revealing time slices. Experiments on four real-world\ndatasets show that ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong\nanomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in autonomous experimentation have demonstrated\nremarkable physical capabilities, yet their cognitive control remains\nlimited--often relying on static heuristics or classical optimization. A core\nlimitation is the absence of a principled mechanism to detect and adapt to the\nunexpectedness. While traditional surprise measures--such as Shannon or\nBayesian Surprise--offer momentary detection of deviation, they fail to capture\nwhether a system is truly learning and adapting. In this work, we introduce\nMutual Information Surprise (MIS), a new framework that redefines surprise not\nas anomaly detection, but as a signal of epistemic growth. MIS quantifies the\nimpact of new observations on mutual information, enabling autonomous systems\nto reflect on their learning progression. We develop a statistical test\nsequence to detect meaningful shifts in estimated mutual information and\npropose a mutual information surprise reaction policy (MISRP) that dynamically\ngoverns system behavior through sampling adjustment and process forking.\nEmpirical evaluations--on both synthetic domains and a dynamic pollution map\nestimation task--show that MISRP-governed strategies significantly outperform\nclassical surprise-based approaches in stability, responsiveness, and\npredictive accuracy. By shifting surprise from reactive to reflective, MIS\noffers a path toward more self-aware and adaptive autonomous systems.",
