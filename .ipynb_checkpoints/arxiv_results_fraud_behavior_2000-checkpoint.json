    "abstract": "The unsupervised detection of anomalies in time series data has important\napplications in user behavioral modeling, fraud detection, and cybersecurity.\nAnomaly detection has, in fact, been extensively studied in categorical\nsequences. However, we often have access to time series data that represent\npaths through networks. Examples include transaction sequences in financial\nnetworks, click streams of users in networks of cross-referenced documents, or\ntravel itineraries in transportation networks. To reliably detect anomalies, we\nmust account for the fact that such data contain a large number of independent\nobservations of paths constrained by a graph topology. Moreover, the\nheterogeneity of real systems rules out frequency-based anomaly detection\ntechniques, which do not account for highly skewed edge and degree statistics.\nTo address this problem, we introduce HYPA, a novel framework for the\nunsupervised detection of anomalies in large corpora of variable-length\ntemporal paths in a graph. HYPA provides an efficient analytical method to\ndetect paths with anomalous frequencies that result from nodes being traversed\nin unexpected chronological order.",

    "abstract": "With the explosive growth of e-commerce, online transaction fraud has become\none of the biggest challenges for e-commerce platforms. The historical\nbehaviors of users provide rich information for digging into the users' fraud\nrisk. While considerable efforts have been made in this direction, a\nlong-standing challenge is how to effectively exploit internal user information\nand provide explainable prediction results. In fact, the value variations of\nsame field from different events and the interactions of different fields\ninside one event have proven to be strong indicators for fraudulent behaviors.\nIn this paper, we propose the Dual Importance-aware Factorization Machines\n(DIFM), which exploits the internal field information among users' behavior\nsequence from dual perspectives, i.e., field value variations and field\ninteractions simultaneously for fraud detection. The proposed model is deployed\nin the risk management system of one of the world's largest e-commerce\nplatforms, which utilize it to provide real-time transaction fraud detection.\nExperimental results on real industrial data from different regions in the\nplatform clearly demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements\ncompared with various state-of-the-art baseline models. Moreover, the DIFM\ncould also give an insight into the explanation of the prediction results from\ndual perspectives.",

    "abstract": "Online fraud often involves identity theft. Since most security measures are\nweak or can be spoofed, we investigate a more nuanced and less explored avenue:\nbehavioral biometrics via handwriting movements. This kind of data can be used\nto verify whether a user is operating a device or a computer application, so it\nis important to distinguish between human and machine-generated movements\nreliably. For this purpose, we study handwritten symbols (isolated characters,\ndigits, gestures, and signatures) produced by humans and machines, and compare\nand contrast several deep learning models. We find that if symbols are\npresented as static images, they can fool state-of-the-art classifiers (near\n75% accuracy in the best case) but can be distinguished with remarkable\naccuracy if they are presented as temporal sequences (95% accuracy in the\naverage case). We conclude that an accurate detection of fake movements has\nmore to do with how users write, rather than what they write. Our work has\nimplications for computerized systems that need to authenticate or verify\nlegitimate human users, and provides an additional layer of security to keep\nattackers at bay.",

    "abstract": "In e-commerce industry, user behavior sequence data has been widely used in\nmany business units such as search and merchandising to improve their products.\nHowever, it is rarely used in financial services not only due to its 3V\ncharacteristics - i.e. Volume, Velocity and Variety - but also due to its\nunstructured nature. In this paper, we propose a Financial Service scenario\nDeep learning based Behavior data representation method for Clustering\n(FinDeepBehaviorCluster) to detect fraudulent transactions. To utilize the\nbehavior sequence data, we treat click stream data as event sequence, use time\nattention based Bi-LSTM to learn the sequence embedding in an unsupervised\nfashion, and combine them with intuitive features generated by risk experts to\nform a hybrid feature representation. We also propose a GPU powered HDBSCAN\n(pHDBSCAN) algorithm, which is an engineering optimization for the original\nHDBSCAN algorithm based on FAISS project, so that clustering can be carried out\non hundreds of millions of transactions within a few minutes. The computation\nefficiency of the algorithm has increased 500 times compared with the original\nimplementation, which makes flash fraud pattern detection feasible. Our\nexperimental results show that the proposed FinDeepBehaviorCluster framework is\nable to catch missed fraudulent transactions with considerable business values.\nIn addition, rule extraction method is applied to extract patterns from risky\nclusters using intuitive features, so that narrative descriptions can be\nattached to the risky clusters for case investigation, and unknown risk\npatterns can be mined for real-time fraud detection. In summary,\nFinDeepBehaviorCluster as a complementary risk management strategy to the\nexisting real-time fraud detection engine, can further increase our fraud\ndetection and proactive risk defense capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Advertising click fraud detection plays one of the vital roles in current\nE-commerce websites as advertising is an essential component of its business\nmodel. It aims at, given a set of corresponding features, e.g., demographic\ninformation of users and statistical features of clicks, predicting whether a\nclick is fraudulent or not in the community. Recent efforts attempted to\nincorporate attributed behavior sequence and heterogeneous network for\nextracting complex features of users and achieved significant effects on click\nfraud detection. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal and Contrastive\nlearning network for Click Fraud detection (MCCF). Specifically, motivated by\nthe observations on differences of demographic information, behavior sequences\nand media relationship between fraudsters and genuine users on E-commerce\nplatform, MCCF jointly utilizes wide and deep features, behavior sequence and\nheterogeneous network to distill click representations. Moreover, these three\nmodules are integrated by contrastive learning and collaboratively contribute\nto the final predictions. With the real-world datasets containing 2.54 million\nclicks on Alibaba platform, we investigate the effectiveness of MCCF. The\nexperimental results show that the proposed approach is able to improve AUC by\n7.2% and F1-score by 15.6%, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "With the explosive growth of the e-commerce industry, detecting online\ntransaction fraud in real-world applications has become increasingly important\nto the development of e-commerce platforms. The sequential behavior history of\nusers provides useful information in differentiating fraudulent payments from\nregular ones. Recently, some approaches have been proposed to solve this\nsequence-based fraud detection problem. However, these methods usually suffer\nfrom two problems: the prediction results are difficult to explain and the\nexploitation of the internal information of behaviors is insufficient. To\ntackle the above two problems, we propose a Hierarchical Explainable Network\n(HEN) to model users' behavior sequences, which could not only improve the\nperformance of fraud detection but also make the inference process\ninterpretable. Meanwhile, as e-commerce business expands to new domains, e.g.,\nnew countries or new markets, one major problem for modeling user behavior in\nfraud detection systems is the limitation of data collection, e.g., very few\ndata/labels available. Thus, in this paper, we further propose a transfer\nframework to tackle the cross-domain fraud detection problem, which aims to\ntransfer knowledge from existing domains (source domains) with enough and\nmature data to improve the performance in the new domain (target domain). Our\nproposed method is a general transfer framework that could not only be applied\nupon HEN but also various existing models in the Embedding & MLP paradigm.\nBased on 90 transfer task experiments, we also demonstrate that our transfer\nframework could not only contribute to the cross-domain fraud detection task\nwith HEN, but also be universal and expandable for various existing models.",
