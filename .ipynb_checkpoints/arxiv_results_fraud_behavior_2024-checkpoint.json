    "abstract": "Modern blockchains face a scalability challenge due to the intrinsic\nthroughput limitations of consensus protocols. Layer 2 optimistic rollups (L2)\nare a faster alternative that offer the same interface in terms of smart\ncontract development and user interaction. Optimistic rollups perform most\ncomputations offchain and make light use of an underlying blockchain (L1) to\nguarantee correct behavior, implementing a cheaper blockchain on a blockchain\nsolution. With optimistic rollups, a sequencer calculates offchain batches of\nL2 transactions and commits batches (compressed or hashed) to the L1\nblockchain. The use of hashes requires a data service to translate hashes into\ntheir corresponding batches. Current L2 implementations consist of a\ncentralized sequencer (central authority) and an optional data availability\ncommittee (DAC).\n  In this paper, we propose a decentralized L2 optimistic rollup based on\nSetchain, a decentralized Byzantine-tolerant implementation of sets. The main\ncontribution is a fully decentralized \"arranger\" where arrangers are a formal\ndefinition combining sequencers and DACs. We prove our implementation correct\nand show empirical evidence that our solution scales. A final contribution is a\nsystem of incentives (payments) for servers that implement the sequencer and\ndata availability committee protocols correctly, and a fraud-proof mechanism to\ndetect violations of the protocol.",

    "abstract": "Fraud detection presents a challenging task characterized by ever-evolving\nfraud patterns and scarce labeled data. Existing methods predominantly rely on\ngraph-based or sequence-based approaches. While graph-based approaches connect\nusers through shared entities to capture structural information, they remain\nvulnerable to fraudsters who can disrupt or manipulate these connections. In\ncontrast, sequence-based approaches analyze users' behavioral patterns,\noffering robustness against tampering but overlooking the interactions between\nsimilar users. Inspired by cohort analysis in retention and healthcare, this\npaper introduces VecAug, a novel cohort-augmented learning framework that\naddresses these challenges by enhancing the representation learning of target\nusers with personalized cohort information. To this end, we first propose a\nvector burn-in technique for automatic cohort identification, which retrieves a\ntask-specific cohort for each target user. Then, to fully exploit the cohort\ninformation, we introduce an attentive cohort aggregation technique for\naugmenting target user representations. To improve the robustness of such\ncohort augmentation, we also propose a novel label-aware cohort neighbor\nseparation mechanism to distance negative cohort neighbors and calibrate the\naggregated cohort information. By integrating this cohort information with\ntarget user representations, VecAug enhances the modeling capacity and\ngeneralization capabilities of the model to be augmented. Our framework is\nflexible and can be seamlessly integrated with existing fraud detection models.\nWe deploy our framework on e-commerce platforms and evaluate it on three fraud\ndetection datasets, and results show that VecAug improves the detection\nperformance of base models by up to 2.48\\% in AUC and 22.5\\% in R@P$_{0.9}$,\noutperforming state-of-the-art methods significantly.",

    "abstract": "The burgeoning e-Commerce sector requires advanced solutions for the\ndetection of transaction fraud. With an increasing risk of financial\ninformation theft and account takeovers, deep learning methods have become\nintegral to the embedding of behavior sequence data in fraud detection.\nHowever, these methods often struggle to balance modeling capabilities and\nefficiency and incorporate domain knowledge. To address these issues, we\nintroduce the multitask CNN behavioral Embedding Model for Transaction Fraud\nDetection. Our contributions include 1) introducing a single-layer CNN design\nfeaturing multirange kernels which outperform LSTM and Transformer models in\nterms of scalability and domain-focused inductive bias, and 2) the integration\nof positional encoding with CNN to introduce sequence-order signals enhancing\noverall performance, and 3) implementing multitask learning with randomly\nassigned label weights, thus removing the need for manual tuning. Testing on\nreal-world data reveals our model's enhanced performance of downstream\ntransaction models and comparable competitiveness with the Transformer Time\nSeries (TST) model.",
